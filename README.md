# Mock University Website

A simple three page website meant to imitate what a University or college would have 
as their own site. Nothing too fancy, there are some neat little CSS tricks to make 
things function without the use of JavaScript. 

---

## Features
There is no JavaScript in this project. Everything was managed with the use of HTML 
and CSS only. 

Notable features in this project include:  
  * A functioning hamburger menu
  * A carousel (albeit basic and simple)
  * Responsive
  * Custom designed crest
  * Internal linking
